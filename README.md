# Learning_Webdev
Learning about web development by implementing my helldivers loadout randomizer as a webapp. The whole process is dockerized, with the data being held in a mongodb, the backend being an express app, and the frontend being html pages served by nginx. Future work includes learning about DNS and lan/wan production.
